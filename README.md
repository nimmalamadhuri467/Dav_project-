This project explores the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and heart attack occurrences in India using a dataset of 550+ vaccinated individuals. It includes age, gender, vaccination history, and key health factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, smoking history, and diabetes status. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we identify potential correlations, assess the impact of pre-existing conditions, and provide insights into cardiovascular health post-vaccination, aiding healthcare research and decision-making.
